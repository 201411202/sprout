# This file lists filenames for which we do not currently expect 100%
# coverage. These are files that existed before we introduced unit
# tests to Sprout, and for which we have not yet written tests. New
# code and new files should have 100% code coverage (by lines); it may
# be acceptable to use exclusion markers to achieve this.
